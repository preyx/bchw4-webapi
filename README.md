###Boot Camp Homework 4 - Web APIs
This page uses Web APIs to generate an interactive quiz for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It randomizes a list of 10 questions with 4 answers each. The player has 99 seconds to complete the quiz. If the player answers incorrectly, 10 seconds are subtracted from the remaining time. The game ends when all 10 questions are answered or there is no time remaining. The score is taken from the time remaining, and the game asks for a name, and shows the player ranking on the high score list. The player may also clear all the high scores.
